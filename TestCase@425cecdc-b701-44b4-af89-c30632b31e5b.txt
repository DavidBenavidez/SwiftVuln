Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   443/tcp

Summary:
The script consolidates various information for CGI scanning.
  This information is based on the following scripts / settings:
  - HTTP-Version Detection (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.100034)
  - No 404 check (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10386)
  - Web mirroring / webmirror.nasl (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10662)
  - Directory Scanner / DDI_Directory_Scanner.nasl (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.1!
1032)
  - The configured 'cgi_path' within the 'Scanner Preferences' of the scan confi!
g in use
  - The configured 'Enable CGI scanning', 'Enable generic web application scanni!
ng' and
    'Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning' within !
the
    'Global variable settings' of the scan config in use
  If you think any of this information is wrong please report it to the referenc!
ed community portal.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The Hostname/IP "10.11.181.158" was used to access the remote host.
Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the "Enable gener!
ic web application scanning" option within the "Global variable settings" of the!
 scan config in use.
Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.
This service seems to be NOT able to host PHP scripts.
This service seems to be NOT able to host ASP scripts.
The User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 9.0.3)" was used to access !
the remote host.
Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for CGI sca!
nning. You can enable this again with the "Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to!
 directories for CGI scanning" option within the "Global variable settings" of t!
he scan config in use.
The following directories were used for CGI scanning:
https://10.11.181.158/
While this is not, in and of itself, a bug, you should manually inspect these di!
rectories to ensure that they are in compliance with company security standards
The following directories were excluded from CGI scanning because the "Regex pat!
tern to exclude directories from CGI scanning" setting of the NVT "Global variab!
le settings" (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.12288) for this scan was: "/(index\.php!

Summary:
This plugin uses wapiti to find
  web security issues.
  Make sure to have wapiti 2.x as wapiti 1.x is not supported.
  See the preferences section for wapiti options.
  Note that the scanner is using limited set of wapiti options. Therefore, for m!
ore complete web
  assessment, you should use standalone wapiti tool for deeper/customized checks!
.
  Note: The plugin needs the 'wapiti' binary found within the PATH of the user r!
unning the scanner and
  needs to be executable for this user. The existence of this binary is checked !
and reported separately
  within 'Availability of scanner helper tools' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.8100!
00).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The wapiti report filename is empty. That could mean that a wrong version of wap!
iti is used or tmp dir is not accessible. Make sure to have wapiti 2.x as wapiti!
 1.x is not supported.
In short: Check the installation of wapiti and the scanner.
