NVT:    Check for enabled / working Port scanner plugin
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108323
Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The script reports if:
  - a custom scan configuration is in use without having a Port scanner from
  the 'Port scanners' family enabled.
  - a port scanner plugin was running into a timeout.
  - a required port scanner (e.g. nmap) is not installed.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The host wasn't scanned due to the following possible reasons:
 - No Port scanner plugin from the "Port scanners" family is included in this sc!
an configuration. Recommended: Nmap (NASL wrapper).
 - The Port scanner plugin reached a timeout during the port scanning phase. Ple!
ase either choose a port range for this target containing less ports or raise th!
e "scanner_plugins_timeout" scanner preference to a higher timeout.

Solution:
Based on the script output please:
  - add a Port scanner plugin from the 'Port scanners' family to this scan
  configuration. Recommended: Nmap (NASL wrapper).
  - either choose a port range for this target containing less ports or raise
  the 'scanner_plugins_timeout' scanner preference to a higher timeout.
  - install the 'nmap' binary/package or make it accessible to the scanner.

Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   22/tcp

Summary:
Identification of SSH protocol versions supported by the remote
  SSH Server. Also reads the corresponding fingerprints from the service.
  The following versions are tried: 1.33, 1.5, 1.99 and 2.0

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The remote SSH Server supports the following SSH Protocol Versions:
1.99
2.0

Summary:
This detects the SSH Server's type and version by connecting to the server
  and processing the buffer received.
  This information gives potential attackers additional information about the sy!
stem they are attacking.
  Versions and Types should be omitted where possible.

Vulnerability Detection Result:

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 2996806038
Packet 2: 2996807203

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP/IPv4 implementations that implement RFC1323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

NVT:    Traceroute
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.51662
Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
A traceroute from the scanning server to the target system was
  conducted. This traceroute is provided primarily for informational value only.!
 In the vast
  majority of cases, it does not represent a vulnerability. However, if the disp!
layed traceroute
  contains any private addresses that should not have been publicly visible, the!
n you have an
  issue you need to correct.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Here is the route from 10.0.4.150 to 10.0.5.157:
10.0.4.150
10.0.5.157

Solution:
Block unwanted packets from escaping your network.
