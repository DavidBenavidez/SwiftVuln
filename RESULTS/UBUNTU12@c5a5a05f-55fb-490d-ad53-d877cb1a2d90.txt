NVT:    Check for enabled / working Port scanner plugin
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108323
Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The script reports if:
  - a custom scan configuration is in use without having a Port scanner from
  the 'Port scanners' family enabled.
  - a port scanner plugin was running into a timeout.
  - a required port scanner (e.g. nmap) is not installed.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The host wasn't scanned due to the following possible reasons:
 - No Port scanner plugin from the "Port scanners" family is included in this sc!
an configuration. Recommended: Nmap (NASL wrapper).
 - The Port scanner plugin reached a timeout during the port scanning phase. Ple!
ase either choose a port range for this target containing less ports or raise th!
e "scanner_plugins_timeout" scanner preference to a higher timeout.

Solution:
Based on the script output please:
  - add a Port scanner plugin from the 'Port scanners' family to this scan
  configuration. Recommended: Nmap (NASL wrapper).
  - either choose a port range for this target containing less ports or raise
  the 'scanner_plugins_timeout' scanner preference to a higher timeout.
  - install the 'nmap' binary/package or make it accessible to the scanner.

arcfour256
blowfish-cbc
cast128-cbc
rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the weak encryption algorithms.

Vulnerability Insight:
The `arcfour` cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit keys.
  The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER]!
. Arcfour (and RC4) has problems
  with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.
  The `none` algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done.
  Note that this method provides no confidentiality protection, and it
  is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.
  A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an !
attacker to recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Check if remote ssh service supports Arcfour, none or CBC ciphers.

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 156432
Packet 2: 156732

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP/IPv4 implementations that implement RFC1323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.
