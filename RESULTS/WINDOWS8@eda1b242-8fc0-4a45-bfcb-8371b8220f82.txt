Please consider the advice given in each description, in order to rectify
the issue.

All dates are displayed using the timezone "Coordinated Universal Time",
which is abbreviated "UTC".

Vendor security updates are not trusted.

Overrides are off.  Even when a result has an override, this report uses
the actual threat of the result.

NVT:    Check for enabled / working Port scanner plugin
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108323
Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The script reports if:
  - a custom scan configuration is in use without having a Port scanner from
  the 'Port scanners' family enabled.
  - a port scanner plugin was running into a timeout.
  - a required port scanner (e.g. nmap) is not installed.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The host wasn't scanned due to the following possible reasons:
 - No Port scanner plugin from the "Port scanners" family is included in this sc!
an configuration. Recommended: Nmap (NASL wrapper).
 - The Port scanner plugin reached a timeout during the port scanning phase. Ple!
ase either choose a port range for this target containing less ports or raise th!
e "scanner_plugins_timeout" scanner preference to a higher timeout.

Solution:
Based on the script output please:
  - add a Port scanner plugin from the 'Port scanners' family to this scan
  configuration. Recommended: Nmap (NASL wrapper).
  - either choose a port range for this target containing less ports or raise
  the 'scanner_plugins_timeout' scanner preference to a higher timeout.
  - install the 'nmap' binary/package or make it accessible to the scanner.

NVT:    OpenSSH Denial of Service And User Enumeration Vulnerabilities (Windows)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.809121
Threat: High (CVSS: 7.8)
Port:   22/tcp

Product detection result: cpe:/a:openbsd:openssh:6.7
Detected by: SSH Server type and version (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10267)

Summary:
This host is installed with openssh and
  is prone to denial of service and user enumeration vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Installed version: 6.7
Fixed version:     7.3

Impact:
Successfully exploiting this issue allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crypt CPU consumption) and
  to enumerate users by leveraging the timing difference between responses
  when a large password is provided.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Upgrade to OpenSSH version 7.3 or later.

Affected Software/OS:
OpenSSH versions before 7.3 on Windows

Vulnerability Insight:
Multiple flaws exist due to,
  - The auth_password function in 'auth-passwd.c' script does not limit password
    lengths for password authentication.
  - The sshd in OpenSSH, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user password hashin!
g
    uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the username does not exist
    and it takes much longer to calculate SHA256/SHA512 hash than BLOWFISH hash.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.

Product detection result: cpe:/a:openbsd:openssh:6.7
Detected by: SSH Server type and version (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10267)

Summary:
This host is installed with openssh and
  is prone to multiple vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Installed version: 6.7
Fixed version:     7.4

Impact:
Successfully exploiting this issue allows
  local users to obtain sensitive private-key information, to gain privileges,
  conduct a senial-of-service condition and allows remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary local PKCS#11 modules.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Upgrade to OpenSSH version 7.4 or later.

Affected Software/OS:
OpenSSH versions before 7.4 on Windows.

Vulnerability Insight:
Multiple flaws exists due to,
  - An 'authfile.c' script does not properly consider the effects of realloc
    on buffer contents.
  - The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression)
    does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers.
  - The sshd in OpenSSH creates forwarded Unix-domain sockets as root, when
    privilege separation is not used.
  - An untrusted search path vulnerability in ssh-agent.c in ssh-agent.
  - NULL pointer dereference error due to an out-of-sequence NEWKEYS message.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 118028
Packet 2: 118143

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP/IPv4 implementations that implement RFC1323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

Summary:
A traceroute from the scanning server to the target system was
  conducted. This traceroute is provided primarily for informational value only.!
 In the vast
  majority of cases, it does not represent a vulnerability. However, if the disp!
layed traceroute
  contains any private addresses that should not have been publicly visible, the!
n you have an
  issue you need to correct.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Here is the route from 10.0.4.150 to 10.0.4.82:
10.0.4.150
10.0.4.82
